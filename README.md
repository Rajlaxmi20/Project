# Project

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Project is to create a package including all the statistical
tests and also a formal report based on the three research questions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Project from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("Rajlaxmi20/Project")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
devtools::load_all()
#> ℹ Loading Project
## basic example code
#question1("project2022.csv")
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push.

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
